LEVEL YOU WISH THE MINI-PROJECT TO BE MARKED FOR: 1 / 2 / 3 [Delete as appropriate]

Now complete the statements below for each level you wish to be marked. Replace all text in square brackets.

LEVEL ONE

My code demonstrates inheritance in the following way...

I have a superclass called [Insert name of superclass here]

This superclass is extended into at least three subclasses called [Insert names of the subclasses here]

For each of the named subclasses complete the following...

Subclass 1.

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by adding at least one property and its getters and setters. The name(s) of the added properties are [Insert names of properties here.]

These/this new properties/property are used by the subclass in the following way: [Insert justification for adding the property and give the line numbers in the code of where the property is used.]

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by overriding the following methods (there must be at least one): [Insert names of overridden methods and their line numbers in the code.]

These overridden methods are used in the working code in the following places: [list the file names and line numbers where the overridden methods are called.]
Subclass 2.

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by adding at least one property and its getters and setters. The name(s) of the added properties are [Insert names of properties here.]

These/this new properties/property are used by the subclass in the following way: [Insert justification for adding the property and give the line numbers in the code of where the property is used.]

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by overriding the following methods (there must be at least one): [Insert names of overridden methods and their line numbers in the code.]

These overridden methods are used in the working code in the following places: [list the file names and line numbers where the overridden methods are called.]

Subclass 3.

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by adding at least one property and its getters and setters. The name(s) of the added properties are [Insert names of properties here.]

These/this new properties/property are used by the subclass in the following way: [Insert justification for adding the property and give the line numbers in the code of where the property is used.]

Subclass [Insert name of subclass] extends the superclass by overriding the following methods (there must be at least one): [Insert names of overridden methods and their line numbers in the code.]

These overridden methods are used in the working code in the following places: [list the file names and line numbers where the overridden methods are called.]

[If you have more than three subclasses you want to tell us about, copy and paste the above text for as many subclasses as you want.]

LEVEL TWO

[In no more than three sentences and in your own words, define polymorphism.]

[List the places in your code where polymorphism is implemented, listing file names and line numbers.]

[Explain briefly (no more than four sentences), why polymorphism is necessary in your code.]

LEVEL THREE

[Explain in three or four sentences how your code responds to a button being pressed (or other user interaction) in the GUI. Give file names and line numbers of where the code is that responds to user interaction.]

[List file names and line numbers of where exception handling is implemented.]

[List file names and line numbers of where Collection classes are used.]

[Explain in no more than three sentences how your code implements file I/O in order to save its complete state.]

ANYTHING ELSE

[If there is anything else that you wish the marker to be aware of, please describe if (briefly) here.]
